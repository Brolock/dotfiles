Various dotfiles and configs that I use on my machines

install_script.sh should install all necessary packages for the system to work and symbolic link config and dotfiles accordingly to my home

! install_script.sh must be run as sudo -- Check the script content before running it as it might overwrite your config files with symbolic links

TODO:
- Add an option so that install_script handles other usernames than mine
- Configure vim & tmux
- Add GTK for darkmode
